            <h3>Digital Divide: Empirical Study of CIUS 2020</h3>
            <p>
                As Canada and other major economies consider implementing “digital money” or Central
Bank Digital Currencies, understanding how demographic and geographic factors influence
public engagement with digital technologies becomes increasingly important. This paper uses
data from the 2020 Canadian Internet Use Survey and employs survey-adapted Lasso inference
methods to identify individual socio-economic and demographic characteristics determining
the digital divide in Canada. We also introduce a score to measure and compare the digital
literacy of various segments of Canadian population. Our findings reveal that disparities in the
use of e.g. online banking, emailing, and digital payments exist across different demographic
and socio-economic groups. In addition, we document the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on
internet use in Canada and describe changes in the characteristics of Canadian internet users
over the last decade.

            <h3>Examining the Role of Child Welfare Worker Characteristics 
                in Their Substantiation Decision</h3> 
             <p>
                 The role of child welfare workers is twofold, to promote the safety of children and youth and 
        to address their wellbeing. This provincially legislated mandate requires child welfare workers 
        to make decisions across the child welfare service continuum. After a report of child 
                 maltreatment is investigated, workers are required to assess the veracity of the allegation 
                 through the substantiation decision and to determine whether the child has been victimized, 
                 which may impact on families' future involvement with services. Little is known whether or how 
                 individual worker characteristics impact the substantiation decision.

            <h3>Digital Adoption and Cyber Security: An
Analysis of Canadian Businesses</h3> 
         <p>
             We examine the integration of digital and financial technologies across Canadian
enterprises, using data from the Canadian Survey of Digital Technology and Internet Use
and the Canadian Survey of Cyber Security and Cybercrime. A Business Digital Usage
Score is developed to assess technological efficiency and econometric models are used to
analyze firms cybersecurity practices'. The analysis reveals a significant digital divide
among Canadian firms and highlights critical risks associated with poor cybersecurity
practices, offering insights for enhancing digital adoption and improved cybersecurity in
Canadian businesses.
